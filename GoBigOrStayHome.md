# Go Big or Stay Home
![Standing Tall - the new Guitar Building in South Florida](https://res.cloudinary.com/doron-cloudinary/image/upload/c_scale,w_1400/2019YIR/guitar-building.jpg)

Seated peacefully in my backyard, overlooking the recently-completed, mighty-stylish casino tower serving today as the marquee landmark for summing up the 2019 highlights in Cloudinary's DevRel team.

Staying home during New Year's is reasonably justified after Google graciously shared my year's-worth travel stats (courtesy of the always-on "I know what you did all year" Pixel). 10 countries and nearly 100,000 miles later didn't lie, no wonder the year flew by, literally!

The travel bug has bitten all members of the all-remote Cloudinary DevRel team this year. Hailing from Seattle, Los Angeles, Miami, United Kingdom, Hungary and Pakistanâ€”we've all spent precious hours seated on steel birds criss-crossing the planet. True to DevRel form - we gave conference talks, taught workshops, staffed sponsored booths, mentored hackathons, ran educational activations and recruited Media Developer Experts to the MDE Program (more on that below).

## JAM with CloudyCAM
![Camera=>Lights=>JAMstack](https://res.cloudinary.com/doron-cloudinary/image/upload/c_scale,w_1400/2019YIR/GetInTheJamWithCloudyCAM.png)

Engaging developers in compelling ways at community events has been the DevRel team's quest from the get go. This year, the speedlite bulb went off and sparked the CloudyCAM virtual photobooth activation at [16 developer events](https://cloudycam.dev) across the US, Europe and Latin America with many hundreds of portraits taken and transformed. If you visited a Cloudinary booth this year, there's a good chance you got in the jam with CloudyCAM too!

CloudyCAM was developed with meticulous attention to developer experience and highlighting state-of-the-art frontend frameworks ([NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)) and deployment platforms ([Zeit Now](https://github.com/zeit/now)). The app evolved over multiple iterations, drawing feedback from developers who stopped at at the virtual photobooth, took their portrait photos and witnessed a static demo page deployed in 15 seconds, featuring image transformations with matching explainers. A [how-to explainer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwpn1pd9kT8&feature=youtu.be&t=108) of CloudyCAM was given by its builder at the recent BackendlessConf.

Building on the success of CloudyCAM in 2019, we're planning to make it broadly accessible by releasing it as an open-source project as well as adding a flexible provisioning module for 3rd-party deployments. Also, in 2020 you can expect to see more educational activations launched by the DevRel team, including a group trivia/quiz app, a conference badge app, an event social networking app, and possibly other group games (all bearing prizes, of course!).

## Media Developer Experts
![Inaugural MDE Roster](https://res.cloudinary.com/doron-cloudinary/image/upload/c_scale,w_1400/2019YIR/MDE-Program-Launch.jpg)

The visual web is growing by leaps and bounds, fueled by abundance of rich media assets - images, videos and more. Alas, media expertise among developers is relatively scarce with a a rapidly-growing need for implementation know-how. Soon enough, millions of developers will be tasked with building a myriad of high-performance, accessible, and responsive web apps and websites. Where will they look to find the answers and build that expertise?

Enter the MDE ([Media Developer Experts](https://cloudinary.rocks/mde)) Program, launched by Cloudinary's DevRel team at [ImageCon Conf](https://imagecon.com) last spring with a 13-strong inaugural roster of subject-matter experts. This exciting career advancement program onboards developers (MDEs) who are subject-matter experts with passion for media and the visual web. MDEs join the program to serve as leaders in their respective developer communities, providing education and sharing their expertise through writing, speaking, and mentoring, as well as organizing events and building apps & tools.

At the time of publishing, the MDE roster has already doubled and is projected to double again in 2020. MDEs receive exclusive access to certified training, support for activities that advance their media expertise and of course, cool swag and perks (an example of which can be seen above). Expect much more to happen around the MDE Program in the coming year, we can't be more excited!

## Show Up, Speak Up

As it turns out, there's often a Stand Up involved, which happened in many events in 2019. According to Tamas, dev advocate and owner of [JAMstack Training](https://jamstack.training), the method of instigating a standing ovation is a well-protected trade secret, only disclosed to those attending one of his talks or workshops. Make sure to [follow him on twitter](https://twitter.com/tpiros) and on his training site.

## The Trend is Your Friend
True to the core DevRel principles we've established in 2016, our content and community involvement this year was focused on *themes*. These themes are the development trends shaping the methodologies, design patterns and best practices adopted by leading app builders in the web and mobile spaces. In no particular order, we've been focused on the following themes throughout 2019:

 - Responsive (RWD, Responsive Images and Videos)
 - Progressive (PWA, Progressive & Lazy Loading, etc.)
 - Accessibility (a11y and *Media Accessibility* aka [m16y](https://m16y.io))
 - Streaming (video, but also transitions, animations, etc.)
 - Immersive (augmented/mixed reality, AI/ML, 3-D, etc.)
 - JAMstack (serverless, headless, frontend frameworks)

Rolling into 2020, we plan to double down our investments in JAMstack developer communities through content/tutorials, tooling/extensions, and showcase apps and activations that broadly *educate*, *entertain*, *excite* and *elevate* the state of media adoption and dissemination by developers everywhere.

In 2019, we focused on React and Vue as the two frontend frameworks that received the most interest from the developer community. We sponsored and spoke at a multitude of events worldwide and showcased apps, tools and activations that we built based on these frameworks. Examples include related frameworks and static site generators based on React and Vue, like Next, Nuxt, Gatsby, and Gridsome.

Community leadership received a lot of attention from [Tessa](https://twitter.com/TessaMero), who (co-)organizes Seattle's [Vue.js Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/SeattleVueJS), [API City Conf](https://apicity.io), and [JAMstack San Francisco](https://www.meetup.com/jamstack-sf), and to top it off, also produced the [welcome reception](https://www.meetup.com/jamstack-sf/events/263683377/) event for the San Francisco JAMstack Conference!

Not to be outdone, on the other side of the world, [Maya Shavin](https://twitter.com/MayaShavin) (co-)organizes [Vue.js Israel Meetup](https://www.vuejsisrael.com) and [JAMstack Israel Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/JAMStack-IL). Maya is also a core team member of [StoreFrontUI](https://www.storefrontui.io), the VueJS-based, Open-Source eCommerce UI Library and a global ambassador for *Media Accessibility* (aka [m16y](https://m16y.io)).

## Cloudy with a Chance of... Apps
![*Cloudinary Inside*](https://res.cloudinary.com/doron-cloudinary/image/upload/c_scale,w_1400/2019YIR/cloudinary-inside.png)
A critical observation we made in 2019 is centered around developer experience (DX) and our need to direct efforts beyond the discovery and comprehension of Cloudinary's features. Stated simply, developers aren't building "media apps" but are rather looking to solve media problems and challenges in the context of apps they're building using various platforms, frameworks, tools and programming languages.

Consequently, our focus shifted to a use case and solution-oriented content and showcase apps 
Consequently our our focus shifted to a use case and solution-oriented content and showcasing apps where Cloudinary is embedded in contexts provided by target technology stacks and ecosystems, hence "*Cloudinary Inside*". As an example, [Doug Sillars](https://twitter.com/dougsillars) delivered ~100 meetup and conference talks all over Europe in 2019. His [content](https://dougsillars.com) covers a detailed overview of problems encountered in efficient and reliable delivery of images and videos, highlighting applicable examples and their practical solutions.

We're working on big ideas to greatly enhance the DX of media platform APIs in 2020, going well beyond talks and tutorials. We're building on compelling tools and cloud infrastructures made available in the here and now, and we believe that the time is ripe for combining the concepts of (1) tech stacks/ecosystems, (2) "*Cloudinary Inside*" and (3) online code editing/sharing, into a compelling DX playground where developers can maximize learning and experimentation with Cloudinary technologies.

## Advocacy, Not Just by the Numbers
In closing, 2019 was another significant milepost marker following the fast-ascending trajectory of Cloudinary's growth. Driven by developer adoption of a powerful media API *(with ~40% growth during 2019 to ~600,000 signups)* to deliver the "visual web" with compelling UX to app users and site visitors. Rest assured, the DevRel team is keeping the eye on the ball: supporting developers in their continued learning and delight with our technologies within the many communities in which they thrive.

From all indications, 2020 is primed to become an even better year for developers everywhere and for the visual web and rich media in particular. In recognition of what lies ahead, the DevRel team is committed to bringing you the best tools and resources to achieve your goals. We are as ready and energized as ever before to continue growing with you along this exciting journey.
